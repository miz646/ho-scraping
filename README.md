Don't know why, but I can't create this app by using Heroku... Therefore, I uploaded mine here.

This app is for Japanese medical students who are searching hospitals to work at as resident doctors in the future.

To use this app, after downloading this, you should install bs4, googlesearch-python, flask, requests in your command line. Sorry for making you to download many stuff...

This app uses HOKUTO RESIDENT, where you can search hospitals to work at as resident doctors. Opening the app, you can find instructions(in Japanese) so please follow them.

Hope you can find your utopia!
